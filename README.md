# JustJDM
#### JDM: (Japanese Domestic Market) refers to automobile parts and vehicles originally designed and manufactured for Japan's local market, and in this project, it relates to analyzing the export performance of top-selling JDM parts to international markets.

## Project Overview 
This project focuses on end-to-end analysis to quantify and visualize sales for the top five most exported automobile parts by a Japanese-exclusive parts exporter. The goal is to develop a high-level Product Analytics Dashboard that provides actionable insights into key product performance metrics. This dashboard will aid strategic decision-making by tracking performance trends and highlighting growth opportunities.
### Dashboard Features:
* Identifies top-performing regions and corresponding revenue.
* Visualizes comparative sales trends over time.
* Summarizes annual growth.
* Shows revenue distribution across discount categories.
* Displays revenue and profit breakdown by country and year.
* Allows users to explore data by region, product, timeframe, and customer.

## Executive Summery 
This analysis consolidates data from three key sources: 
* order records detailing sales, buyers, and purchase locations
* product details of the top five exported parts
* discount data per sale. Covering 2022 and 2023
  
The study reveals a decline in sales and profits. The sharpest decline is seen in engine combustion system components, potentially reflecting a shift toward electric vehicles or the impact of rising fuel costs following the Russia-Ukraine war, discouraging investment in high-performance engine parts. Additionally, sales peak during spring and fall, suggesting seasonal demand patterns that may align with vehicle maintenance cycles or industry trends.
