### About JustJDM  

**JustJDM** is a pseudonym used for a real JDM car parts exporter based in Japan. The business specializes in a wide range of components, from minor parts to complete engines and major vehicle systems. 

### Project Overview  

This project conducts a **comprehensive sales analysis** of the top five most-exported **lower-middle-tier JDM parts** sold by JustJDM. The primary objective is to develop a **Product Analytics Dashboard** that delivers actionable insights into key product performance metrics. By visualizing sales trends, this dashboard will support **strategic decision-making**, highlight growth opportunities, and provide a data-driven approach to optimizing exports.

### Dashboard Features:
* Identifies top-performing regions and corresponding revenue.
* Visualizes comparative sales trends over time.
* Summarizes annual growth.
* Shows revenue distribution across discount categories.
* Displays revenue and profit breakdown by country and year.
* Allows users to explore data by region, product, timeframe, and customer.

## Executive Summery 
This analysis consolidates data from three key sources: 
* order records detailing sales, buyers, and purchase locations
* product details of the top five exported parts
* discount data per sale. Covering 2022 and 2023
  
JustJDM's export sales analysis of 1.037K records ranging from 2022-2023 reveals a decline in sales by 3% and profits by 1%. The sharpest decline is seen in engine combustion system components with an average decline in profts of 17% across all parts, potentially reflecting a shift toward electric vehicles, discouraging investment in high-performance engine parts. Additionally, sales peak during spring and fall with single day profits doubling from the average at $8k, suggesting seasonal demand patterns that may align with vehicle maintenance cycles or industry trends.

- UAE was the second highest at **$609K** and the exports were more consistent throughout the year. 
- The United States ranked third at **$606K**, with nearly **one-third** of its export revenue coming from the **RB26DETT N1 Oil Pump**.  
- Around **42%** of buyer were commercial resellers accounting for nearly **$1.3M** in exports.
- **34%** of every all sales have a high dicount. 

### Insights by Parts:  
- Toyota's **4A-GE "Silver Top" Throttle Body** saw the biggest revenue decline (**21%**), primarily due to a **45%** drop in exports to Germany.  
- Honda's **B-series VTEC Solenoid (OEM)** experienced an **11%** decline in sales, driven by a **38%** reduction in revenue from the UAE.  
- Subaru's **EJ207 AVCS Cam Gear** saw an approximate **30%** revenue increase across all countries.

### Seasonal Trends:  
- **Spring and fall** see significantly higher exports, indicating a cyclical demand pattern.  
- There was a notable export spike in **March of both years**, likely correlating with the start of summer. This suggests that consumers upgrade their vehicles for recreational use during warmer months. **(Interestingly, the UAE showed minimal seasonal variation, which aligns with its stable climate.)**  
- The **fall and early winter export increase** could be worth further exploration, potentially correlating with the holiday season when consumers have more free time.

## Recommendations: 

#### **1. Expand Inventory for Skyline Products**  
- **Opportunity:** Nearly **one-third** of U.S. export revenue comes from the **RB26DETT N1 Oil Pump**, a critical Nissan Skyline R34[1] component.  
- **Market Trend:** The **25-year import rule ends in 2025-26**, allowing the legal import of R34 models into the U.S., which is expected to **significantly increase demand** for Skyline-related parts.  
- **Action Plan:**  
  - Expand **inventory** of high-demand Skyline components, focusing on **R34-specific parts**.  
  - Identify and **prioritize** products with strong market demand, such as **engine components, drivetrain parts, and aftermarket modifications**.  
  - Assess competitors' pricing and stock availability to position JustJDM competitively in the market.  
- **Expected Impact:**  
  - **Stabilized revenue and improved profit margins** by shifting resources from loss-leading products.  
  - **Mitigation of export decline** through strategic inventory management.  
  - **Enhanced brand positioning** as a go-to supplier for Skyline parts ahead of the market surge.  

#### **2. Implement Seasonal Bulk Discounts for Commercial Resellers**  
- **Current Insight:** **42% of total business** comes from commercial resellers, with **significant export spikes in March and October**, indicating cyclical demand.  
- **Market Behavior:** Resellers often **stock up ahead of peak seasons**, and bulk discount incentives could **drive higher order volumes**.  
- **Action Plan:**  
  - Implement **seasonal bulk order discounts** with **tiered pricing** to incentivize larger purchases.  
  - Structure discount percentages based on **order volume**, ensuring profitability while driving sales growth.  
  - Communicate promotions **well in advance** to resellers to align with their **stocking cycles**.

- **Expected Impact:**  
  - **Increased reseller engagement** and **higher purchase volumes** during peak seasons.  
  - **Optimized inventory turnover**, reducing potential stockpile issues.  
  - **Greater market share** among commercial buyers through strategic pricing incentives.  

#### **3. Expand into Geographically Closer Markets**  
- **Geographic Revenue Trends:**  
  - **Australia ($613K) and UAE ($609K)** show the highest sales, while revenues **decline in distant markets** like the **UK ($559K) and Germany ($540K)**.  
  - The **distance from Japan likely impacts shipping costs and overall demand** in far-reaching regions.  
- **Emerging Market Potential:**

 ## Limitations

* **Limited product sample:** The dataset includes only 5 engine-specific products, which may not accurately reflect trends across the broader JDM export market. This narrow scope introduces omitted variable bias, potentially leading to false positives or negatives in market assessments. Expanding the dataset to include suspension, drivetrain, and body components would provide a more comprehensive analysis.

* **Limitations around time period:** The dataset covers only 2022 and 2023, a period impacted by a war [4], which caused a 56% spike in fuel prices. Given that the analyzed parts are primarily engine components, this may lead to false negatives in long-term demand trends. Additionally, seasonal sales spikes observed during this period may be false positives, influenced by temporary market disruptions rather than consistent patterns. Expanding the timeframe would improve trend reliability.
